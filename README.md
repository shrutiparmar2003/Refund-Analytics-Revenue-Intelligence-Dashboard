## Pipeline Summary

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Data Wrangling (Python)
- Removed duplicates, nulls, and zero-value transactions
- Flagged refund transactions using invoice patterns (`Cxxxx`)
- Classified customers into `Guest` / `Registered`
- Segmented items as `Product` / `Service` using keyword logic
- Engineered features: `InvoiceHour`, `InvoiceWeekday`, `TotalAmount`, etc.

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Metric Design & SQL Analytics
Executed 20+ optimized SQL queries to extract:

- **Revenue & refund breakdowns** by time, geography, and product
- **Top customers** by revenue contribution
- **Refund rate %** across descriptions and countries
- **Temporal behavior** of sales and refunds (hour, weekday, month)
- Identification of **loss-leading products** with high refund rates

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Dashboard Design (Power BI)
Created a structured, multi-tab dashboard with:

- **Page 1**: Revenue overview (KPIs, country-wise revenue, customer types)
- **Page 2**: Refund analysis (refund hotspots, product-wise refund %)
- **Page 3**: Customer & product performance (top customers, refund-prone items)

#### Visuals Used

- **Cards** â€“ for KPIs (revenue, refund %)
- **Bar & Line Charts** â€“ for comparison and trends
- **Donut Charts** â€“ for contribution analysis

## Key Insights & Business Takeaways

- Registered customers drove ~89% of revenue
- Refunds accounted for ~4.64% of revenue (~Â£479K)
- USA had an unusually high refund rate of 51.66%
- Revenue peaked in November & December (seasonal trend)
- Refunds spiked on Fridays â€” potential batch return behavior
- Some top-selling products also had high refund rates (>10%)

These insights can help e-commerce businesses refine product quality, target customer retention, and reduce operational loss.
